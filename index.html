      </div>

      <div class="timeline-event">
        <h3>1901</h3>
        <p>Alice's father became president, and headstrong Alice became the center of attention. She did unheard of things such as wear pants, gamble, and race cars down the street.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-event">
        <h3>1906</h3>
        <p>Alice married Ohio Representative Nicholas Longworth and became more of a politician than a socialite. Even after her husband's death, she maintained her social and political influence. She even campaigned against her 5th cousin Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-event">
        <h3>1912–1970</h3>
        <p>She was well known for decades after her father's presidency. She was banned from the White House by President William Howard Taft for burying a voodoo doll of Taft's wife in the yard. She was also banned by President Woodrow Wilson for making a joke about him.</p>
